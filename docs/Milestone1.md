# Milestone 1
[Home](./index.md)

The purpose of this milestone was to design a motion control system for our robot.

The tasks we set out to complete included:
  * Getting our robot to successfully follow a line
  * Getting our robot to successfully traverse a grid in a figure eight.
  
Additionally, we focused on: 
  * Developing a robust control system, and
  * Getting our robot to complete these tasks at a reasonably high speed
    
The only materials used for this milestone that weren't used in lab one were 3 QTR-1A reflectance sensors ([datasheet here:](https://www.pololu.com/product/958))
